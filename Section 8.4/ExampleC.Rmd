This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

First we load the data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data <- scan("Illinois60.csv")
data <- c(data, scan("Illinois61.csv"))
data <- c(data, scan("Illinois62.csv"))
data <- c(data, scan("Illinois63.csv"))
data <- c(data, scan("Illinois64.csv"))

          
```

```{r}
length(data)
```
The data has been loaded correctly.

We will model the data with a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. From the text, the method of moments estimates of the parameters are

$$
\hat{\alpha} = \frac{\bar{X}^2}{\hat{\sigma}^2}
$$

and

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\bar{X}}{\hat{\sigma}^2}
$$

Now we calculate $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{\sigma}^2$.

```{r}
xbar = mean(data)
sigma2hat = var(data)
bhat = xbar / sigma2hat
ahat = bhat * xbar
```

The data has $\bar{X} =$ `r xbar` and $\hat{\sigma}^2 =$ `r sigma2hat`. This produces estimates of $\hat{\alpha} =$ `r ahat` and $\hat{\beta} =$ `r bhat`.

Now we will calculate the standard errors for these estimates. We will generate 1000 samples of 227 draws from a gamma distribution with $\hat{\alpha} =$ `r ahat` and $\hat{\beta} =$ `r bhat`, then calculate 1000 isntances of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$, then take the standard deviations of those estimates and use them as estimates for the standard deviation of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$.




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
